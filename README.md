<h1 align="center" id="title"> Vital Signs Monitoring App</h1>

<p id="description">
  This application serves as an insightful demonstration of generating and showcasing BloodPressure and Pulse values.
  By tapping the Floating Action Button the application utilizes a mock that generates random values of hypothetical blood pressure and pulse readings for a user.
  The application is integrated with Firestore, storing vital sign readings in the Firestore cloud, ensuring data consistency and offering real-time synchronization. 
  New vital sign readings are smoothly fetched and displayed. Additionally, within the RecyclerView list, rows are color-highlighted based on the readings to draw the user's attention to any concerning values.
